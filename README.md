# Encoding Techniques in Machine Learning

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various encoding techniques using the `sklearn` library and custom map functions. The encoding techniques covered are:

- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Ordinal Encoding

The dataset used for these examples is `dataset1.xlsx`.

## Introduction

In machine learning, encoding categorical data is a crucial preprocessing step. This repository provides practical examples of three common encoding techniques: 
- Label Encoding,
- One-Hot Encoding
- Ordinal Encoding.
The examples use the `sklearn` library and demonstrate how to apply these techniques to a sample dataset (`dataset1.xlsx`).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the different encoding techniques:

- `LabelEncoding.ipynb`
- `OneHotEncoding.ipynb`
- `OrdinalEncoding.ipynb`

Each notebook contains code examples and explanations of the respective encoding technique.

## Notebooks

### Label Encoding

This notebook demonstrates how to convert categorical labels into numerical values using `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn`.

### One Hot Encoding

This notebook shows how to transform categorical features into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms using `OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn` and custom implementations.

### Ordinal Encoding

This notebook illustrates how to assign numerical values to ordered categories using `OrdinalEncoder` from `sklearn` and custom map functions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in these notebooks is `dataset1.xlsx`. Make sure the dataset is in the root directory of the repository. The dataset contains sample data used to demonstrate the encoding techniques.
